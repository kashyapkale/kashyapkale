## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **generalist full-stack engineer with a strong systems backbone**.  
I’ve built **large-scale backend and AI platforms** at Amazon and Tray, working on:

- Distributed & event-driven systems  
- System reliability, scalability, and performance  
- AI infrastructure and RAG pipelines  
- Cloud-native architectures on AWS & Azure  

Whether it’s **shipping production systems**, **building AI agents**, or **digging into low-level performance problems**, I enjoy owning problems end-to-end.
